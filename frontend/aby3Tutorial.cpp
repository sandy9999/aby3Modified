	// for details.
	setup(partyIdx, ios, enc, eval, runtime);

	// The main way to use ABY3 requires a basic understanding
	// of asynchonous programming. Lets start with a simple example.

	// Here we want party 0 to input a secret shared integer.
	// This basic type for this is a si64 (secret shared 64-bit 
	// signed integer). 
	si64 sharedInt;
	std::cout<<"Welcome to Integer Operations\n";

	// At this point it is uninitialized. To put a value into it, 
	// the parties must run a protocol. This is done as follows.

	Sh3Task inputTask;
	if (partyIdx == 0)
	{
		// we will have party 0 provide the value
		inputTask = enc.localInt(runtime, 42, sharedInt);
	}
	else
	{
		// the other parties must help party 0 by calling remoteInt.
		inputTask = enc.remoteInt(runtime, sharedInt);
	}

	// However, at this point nothing has actually happen. sharedInt
	// has not been populated with the value of 42. To actually make 
	// this happen with must call get() on the return value of these
	// functions. That is,

	inputTask.get();

	// It is now the case that sharedInt == 42.

	// For less typing, we can also do the same thing by typing
	if (partyIdx == 0)
		enc.localInt(runtime, 21, sharedInt).get();
	else 
		enc.remoteInt(runtime, sharedInt).get();
		
	// Not that we called .get() on the return type. This will the
	// runtime that we want the value right now.

	// You might be wondering why we would want to wait to get the 
	// value secret shared. This is because we secret sharing a value
	// requires the parties to interact (send messages) which takes
	// time. If we want to secret share many values, e.g.

	std::vector<si64> sharedVec(20);

	// Then it would take several round trips to compute
	for (u64 i = 0; i < sharedVec.size(); ++i)
	{
		if (i % 3 == partyIdx)
			enc.localInt(runtime, i, sharedVec[i]).get();
		else
			enc.remoteInt(runtime, sharedVec[i]).get();
	}
	// This is because (more or less) each one of these 
	// operations must be completed before the next can 
	// start. This mean that who ever is inputting the 
	// value must sends shares of the value to the other
	// who must then wait. This then happens for the next 
	// value.

	// However, if we instead computed it as
	Sh3Task task;
	for (u64 i = 0; i < sharedVec.size(); ++i)
	{
		if (i % 3 == partyIdx)
			task &= enc.localInt(runtime, i, sharedVec[i]);
		else
			task &= enc.remoteInt(runtime, sharedVec[i]);
	}

	task.get();

	// Then all of these operations get performed in parallel.
	// This is critical to understand in order to acheive good
	// performance.

	// Note that we AND'ed together several tasks. This results
	// the task.get() meaning that you want to get the result
	// of all of the tasks.


	// Now that we have some shared values, lets do some computation!

	// We can add shares together with little to no costs.
	si64 sum = sharedVec[0];
	for (u64 i = 1; i < sharedVec.size(); ++i)
		sum = sum + sharedVec[i];

	// However, multiplication is a bit more involved due to it
	// requiring communication. The same type of operations would 
	// look like
	si64 prod = sharedVec[0];
	task = runtime.noDependencies();
	for (u64 i = 1; i < sharedVec.size(); ++i)
		task = eval.asyncMul(task, prod, sharedVec[i], prod);

	task.get();

	// Here we are computing the product of the values in sharedVec.
	// First we computed (sharedVec[0] * sharedVec[1]). We then take
	// the result and multipluply it with sharedVec[2] and so on. Each
	// mutltiplication depends on the previous and therefore we can 
	// express this by passing the dependent task as input to the next
	// multiplication. This tell the runtime to wait until the previous 
	// multiplication is completed before performing the next.

	// Alternatively, we could have done the same thing as
	prod = sharedVec[0];
	for (u64 i = 1; i < sharedVec.size(); ++i)
		eval.asyncMul(runtime, prod, sharedVec[1], prod).get();

	// However, this would not have allowed us to run other operations
	// in "parallel". In this case it does not matter but sometime we 
	// have parallel work that could be performed. 

	// To reconstruct a result, we can do this by calling 
	// Sh3Evaluator::revealAll(...).
	i64 prodVal;
	enc.revealAll(runtime, prod, prodVal).get();

	// This will reveal the value to all of the parties, we can 
	// alternative reveal it to one party by 
	if (partyIdx == 0)
	{
		i64 sumVal;
		enc.reveal(runtime, sum, sumVal).get();
	}
